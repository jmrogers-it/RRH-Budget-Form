# Client Budget Form

A mobile-friendly web form for collecting monthly household income and expense information from clients. Staff can fill it out on an iPhone, then print it or save it as a PDF directly from the browser.

---

## Accessing the Form

Open the following link in Safari on your iPhone or in any web browser on a computer:

**https://jmrogers-it.github.io/RRH-Budget-Form/**

No app download or login is required.

---

## How to Use the Form

2. The **Date** will automatically be set to today. You can change it if needed by tapping on it.
3. Enter the client's **Anticipated Monthly Income**.
4. Fill in any monthly expense amounts that apply. Fields you leave blank are simply ignored. Amounts auto-format to currency (e.g. `$1,200.00`) when you move to the next field.
5. The **summary bar** at the bottom shows Total Income, Total Expenses, and Remaining Balance (labeled Surplus or Deficit) and updates automatically as you type.
6. When finished, tap **Print** to print or save as a PDF (see instructions below).

## Printing from an iPhone

### Option 1 — Print to a Wireless Printer (AirPrint)

1. Fill out the form in Safari.
2. Tap the **Print** button at the top of the form.
3. Safari will open a print preview showing the form as a single page.
4. Tap **Printer** and select your AirPrint-compatible printer from the list.
5. Make sure **Paper Size** is set to **US Letter** and **Orientation** is set to **Portrait**.
6. Tap the blue **Print** button in the top right corner.

> **Note:** Your iPhone and printer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for AirPrint to work.

### Option 2 — Save as a PDF (No Printer Needed)

If you don't have access to a printer, you can save the completed form as a PDF file instead.

1. Fill out the form in Safari.
2. Tap the **Print** button at the top of the form.
3. Safari will open a print preview.
4. **Pinch outward** on the page preview with two fingers (like zooming into a photo). This will open the page as a PDF.
5. Tap the **Share** button (the box with an arrow pointing up) in the top right corner.
6. Choose where to save or send the PDF — for example:
   - **Save to Files** — saves it to your iPhone's Files app
   - **Mail** — attaches it to an email
   - **AirDrop** — sends it wirelessly to a nearby Mac or iPhone

## Printing from a Computer

1. Open the form in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox).
2. Fill out the form.
3. Click the **Print** button at the top of the form.
4. In the print dialog, make sure:
   - **Paper size** is set to **Letter**
   - **Orientation** is set to **Portrait**
   - **Scale** is set to **100%**
5. Select your printer and click **Print**.

To save as a PDF on a computer, choose **Save as PDF** (or **Microsoft Print to PDF** on Windows) from the printer selection dropdown instead of selecting a physical printer.

## Project Files

This form is made up of three files that must be kept in the same folder:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The form structure and content |
| `styles.css` | All visual styling, including mobile card layout and print layout |
| `script.js` | Auto date, live calculations, currency formatting, and clear form logic |

---

## Features

- **Mobile responsive** — card-style layout on phones, two-column on desktop
- **Sticky summary bar** — income, expenses, and surplus/deficit remain visible while scrolling on mobile
- **Currency auto-format** — amounts format to `$1,200.00` on blur; numeric keyboard appears automatically on mobile
- **Print optimized** — always prints as a compact, single-page letter-sized document with a border box
- **Surplus / Deficit indicator** — remaining balance is labeled and color-coded
- **Accessible** — all inputs have screen reader labels
- **Auto date** — date field defaults to today's date
- **No server required** — runs entirely in the browser, no internet connection needed once loaded

---

## Making Changes

To update the list of expense categories, open `index.html` in a text editor and find the relevant section. Each row follows this pattern:

```html
<tr>
  <td class="cat">Category Name</td>
  <td class="amt"><input type="text" inputmode="decimal" placeholder="0.00" data-total></td>
</tr>
```

To change colors or fonts, edit `styles.css`. The main brand color variables are at the top of the file:

```css
--blue:   #1a3a5c;
--accent: #c0392b;
```

## Publishing Changes

The live form is served by GitHub Pages from the `main` branch of
[jmrogers-it/RRH-Budget-Form](https://github.com/jmrogers-it/RRH-Budget-Form).
Any commit pushed to `main` goes live at the link above within a minute or
two; a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R, or Cmd+Shift+R on a Mac) clears the
cached copy if you still see the old version.

Because the URL is built from the GitHub account name and the repository
name, renaming either one changes the link staff use — update this README
and re-share the link if that happens.
